# Generics
## Design and Implementation of Generics in .NET
In .NET the generics is supported from virtual machine layer not just in compilation alone.

### Designing goals
1. Safety : *Bugs are catched at compile time.*
2. Expressivity : *Different specialization using type parameter.*
3. Clarity : *Less casting between types.*
4. Efficiency : *Reduced or no need of run time checks.* 

- **Parameterized types** : A type whic accept other types as parameter.
- **Polymorphic methods** : Methods which can accept the types as well as values and act based on that.
